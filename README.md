# Employee Tracking App

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This application offers companies a solution for managing their employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

```
As a business owner

So that I can organize and plan my business

## Tests

There has not been a test script written for this application yet.

## Issues

Due to time constraints, this application is still under development. The function to update an employees' role is not complete, and the "All Done" choices is not working as intended.

Future development will correct these issues, as well as adding additional features like updating an employees' manager, view employees my manager, and delete departments, roles, and employees.
